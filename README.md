# TicTacToe
Exercise 1: Tic Tac Toe (100 points)

Write a complete Java console program that plays Tic Tac Toe with the user.

The program displays a 3 by 3 grid, which is initially blank. 
When the player takes a turn, an X is added to the grid. 
When the computer takes a turn, a O is added to the grid. 
After each turn, simply print out the grid. 
As a result, old states of the grid will scroll up in the console window.
After each turn, your code needs to check for a win or a tie. 
If either of these conditions are met, then the program displays the result and terminates.
You need to use an internal evaluation strategy after each move to make sure that the computer can never lose.
